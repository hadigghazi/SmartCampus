<!-- How to run -->
<img src="./readme/title10.svg"/>

> To set up **SmartCampus** locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) (version 8.1 or higher)

- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) for database management
- [Mailtrap Account](https://mailtrap.io/) for email services during development (Optional)
- [Firebase Account](https://console.firebase.google.com/) for both the **Frontend** and **Chat** applications, you will need to create Firebase projects (Optional)

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository with submodules:**

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hadigghazi/SmartCampus.git
   cd SmartCampus
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   For each submodule, navigate to its directory and install the dependencies.

   - Frontend (`SmartCampus-Frontend`):
     ```bash
     cd SmartCampus-Frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - Chat App (`SmartCampus-Chat`):
     ```bash
     cd ../SmartCampus-Chat
     npm install
     ```
   - Backend (`SmartCampus-Backend`):
     ```bash
     cd ../SmartCampus-Backend
     composer install
     php artisan jwt:secret # To generate `JWT_SECRET` in your `.env` file
     ```
   - Evaluation API (`SmartCampus-Evaluation`):
     ```bash
     cd ../SmartCampus-Evaluation
     python -m venv course_eval_env
     source course_eval_env/bin/activate # Activate environment (MacOS, Linux) 
     .\course_eval_env\Scripts\activate # Activate environment (Windows) 
     cd course-evaluation
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **MySQL Database Setup:**

   - Ensure that MySQL is installed and running on your system.
   - Create a new MySQL database by logging into your MySQL server:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p
     CREATE DATABASE smart_campus_db;
     ```
   - Update your `.env` file in the `SmartCampus-Backend` directory with the following MySQL configuration:

     ```env
     DB_CONNECTION=mysql
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
     DB_PORT=3306
     DB_DATABASE=smart_campus_db
     DB_USERNAME=your_mysql_username
     DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
     ```
     
   - Update your `main.py` file in the `SmartCampus-Evaluations/course-evaluation` directory with the following MySQL configuration:

     ```bash
     DATABASE_URL = "mysql+pymysql://your_mysql_username:your_mysql_password@localhost/smart_campus_db"
     ```
     
   To create the database locally, you can either:
   
   - **Import the `smart_campus_db.sql` file** provided in the `/readme/assets` directory, which contains the full exported database.
   
   - **Run the contents of the `SmartCampus_db.sql` file**, which is also available in the `/readme/assets` directory and contains the SQL queries to create the database tables and set up relationships.
   
   Choose the method that works best for you to ensure the `smart_campus_db` database is available locally with the required tables.

4. **Firebase Setup (Optional, only if you want to run the chatting functionalities):**

   You will need to create two Firebase projects:

   - One for the Frontend (SmartCampus-Frontend) to manage course channels.
   - Another for the Chat App (SmartCampus-Chat) to handle chat functionality.

   **Frontend Firebase Setup:**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a project, and set up the Firebase Realtime Database and Storage for course channels.
   - Copy your Firebase API key and other necessary credentials into the `.env` file in `SmartCampus-Frontend`:

     ```env
     VITE_FIREBASE_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
     ```

   **Chat Firebase Setup:**
   - Similarly, create a new project for the Chat App and configure Firebase to manage chat functionalities. In this case, Firebase authentication is used because the chat 
    feature needs to be accessible even to users who are not authenticated within the system.
   - Copy the Firebase API key into the `.env` file in `SmartCampus-Chat`:

     ```env
     VITE_API_KEY=your_firebase_chat_api_key
     ```

5. **Mailtrap Setup (Optional, only if you want to enable the email functionality):**

   For the announcements email functionality, you can use Mailtrap (used for development and testing):

   - Create an account at [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/).
   - Copy the SMTP credentials and update the `.env` file in `SmartCampus-Backend`:

     ```env
     MAIL_MAILER=smtp
     MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
     MAIL_PORT=2525
     MAIL_USERNAME=your_mailtrap_username
     MAIL_PASSWORD=your_mailtrap_password
     MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
     MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=admin@smartcampus.com
     MAIL_FROM_NAME="SmartCampus"
     ```

6. **Configure Environment Files:**

   Ensure that your `.env` files in both the frontend and backend have the correct URLs and API keys set up:

   - **Frontend `.env` (SmartCampus-Frontend):**

     ```env
     VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
     VITE_CHAT_URL=http://localhost:3001
     VITE_FAST_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
     VITE_FIREBASE_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_for_channels
     ```

   - **Backend `.env` (SmartCampus-Backend):**

     ```env
     APP_NAME=SmartCampus
     APP_ENV=local
     APP_DEBUG=true
     APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

     MAIL_MAILER=smtp
     MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
     MAIL_PORT=2525
     MAIL_USERNAME=your_mailtrap_username
     MAIL_PASSWORD=your_mailtrap_password
     MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
     MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=admin@smartcampus.com
     MAIL_FROM_NAME="SmartCampus"

     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     
     DB_CONNECTION=mysql
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
     DB_PORT=3306
     DB_DATABASE=smart_campus_db
     DB_USERNAME=your_mysql_username
     DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
     ```

   - **Chat `.env` (SmartCampus-Chat):**

     ```env
     VITE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_for_chat
     ```

7. **Run the Applications:**

   - **Frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript)**:

     Navigate to `SmartCampus-Frontend` and run the development server:

     ```bash
     cd SmartCampus-Frontend
     npm run dev
     ```

     The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

   - **Chat App (React)**:

     Navigate to `SmartCampus-Chat` and start the app:

     ```bash
     cd ../SmartCampus-Chat
     npm run dev
     ```

     The chat will run on `http://localhost:3001`.

   - **Backend (Laravel)**:

     Start the Laravel server in `SmartCampus-Backend`:

     ```bash
     cd ../SmartCampus-Backend
     php artisan serve
     ```

     The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

   - **Evaluation Service (FastAPI)**:

     Navigate to `SmartCampus-Evaluation/course-evaluation` and run the FastAPI server:

     ```bash
     cd ../SmartCampus-Evaluation/course-evaluation
     uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
     ```

     The evaluation API will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

---

Now you should have the entire SmartCampus project running locally on your machine, with the following:

- Frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
- Chat App on `http://localhost:3001`
- Backend API on `http://localhost:8000`
- Evaluation Service on `http://localhost:5000`
